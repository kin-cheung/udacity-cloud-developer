Deploy Static Website on AWS

In this project, you will deploy a static website to AWS using S3, CloudFront, and IAM.

The files included are: 

index.html - The Index document for the website.
/img - The background image file for the website.
/vendor - Bootssrap CSS framework, Font, and JavaScript libraries needed for the website to function.
/css - CSS files for the website.


URL for the website:

Hi reviewer, I got a question. If I have my own website URL, do I also need to use Router53 so that users can access my website through my website URL instead of the one given by cloudfront?
